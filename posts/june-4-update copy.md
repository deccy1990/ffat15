Yesterday's Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1kqw55k/2511_patch_preview/

>>> Champion Buffs <<<
Aatrox
"Our Aatrox changes also undershot a bit; so at least trying to put him back to where he was last patch"

[P] Deathbringer Stance post-mitigation damage heal ratio increased 80% >>> 100%

[E-P] Umbral Dash post-mitigation damage healing bonus HP ratio increased 0.9% per 100 bonus HP >>> 1.1% per 100 bonus HP

Aphelios
"Some buffs to Aphelios’ early game here, maintaining his “slow and assailable, but high output” playstyle. If there are spots he can be safe, he should be pumping output a lot better and this will be decent buffs to his early laning"

Base Attack Speed increased 0.64 >>> 0.665

[Calibrum-Q] Calibrum, the Sniper Rifle - Moonshot base damage increased 60/76.67/93.33/110/126.67/143.33/160 >>> 70/85/100/115/130/145/160 (based on levels 1/3/5/7/9/11/13)

[Severum-Q] Severum, the Scythe Pistol - Onslaught base bonus Move Speed increased 20% >>> 25%

Aurora
"Aurora struggles a bunch into some of the mages that outrange her and some of the tankier champions that she struggles to kill later in the game. Giving her more opportunities in the short term to play these lanes out without skewing her to top (where MR is less useful) and also bumping her AP Ratios on R, as they’re more likely to be effective compared to the Liandrys style builds that she often opts into in top lane"

Base Magic Resistance increased 30 >>> 32

[R] Between Worlds AP ratio increased 60% >>> 70%

Bard
"We considered a few changes for Bard, but opted to amp him up in his matchups where he’s free to roam (eg. Braum, Rakan, etc.) compared to buffing his early durability, so he could facetank Alistar engages for example. While that would make him viable, it’s not a particularly long term sustainable one"

Base Move Speed increased 330 >>> 335

Bel'Veth
[R] Endless Banquet buffs:

Cast range increased 275 >>> 450

No longer locks out non-flash Summoner Spells

Garen
"Our Garen changes were pretty under-magnitude. Looking to further his AD incentives to make some of the more AD oriented fighter builds more viable. Our changes narrowed the gap from Cleaver to Phantom Dancer, but it's still a bit far off"

[E] Judgment adjustments:

Damage per tick adjusted 4/8/12/16/20 (+36/38/40/42/44% AD) >>> 4/7/10/13/16 (+36/39/42/45/48% AD)

Armor reduction bug fix

Jax
"Jax has been a bit weaker than other options; looking to give him a nice AS boost throughout the game and also will help bump his jungle viability a tad"

[P] Relentless Assault bonus Attack Speed per Relentless Assault stack increased 3.5/5/6.5/8/9.5/11% >>> 5/6.5/8/9.5/11/12.5% (based on levels 1/4/7/10/13/16) (maximum increased 28/40/52/64/76/88% >>> 40/52/64/76/88/100%)

LeBlanc
"Leblanc is another burst oriented champ that has been worse for wear recently; giving her a bit more of an opportunity to drive tempo throughout the game, especially with a big buff on the level 11 spike"

[E] Ethereal Chains fracture AP ratio increased 80% >>> 85%

[R] Mimic cooldown reduced 50/45/30 >>> 45/35/25 seconds

Lee Sin
"Lee Sin has fallen out of favor compared to a lot of the other AD junglers; especially in a more coordinated environment. Looking to carve out more of a strategic identity for him compared to the other AD fighters in particular. He is one of the few champions where him being a carry champ also buffs allies and we're leaning into that aspect"

"Lee Sin is getting a bit more throughput on his early ganks to help land Q’s and also speed up his clear a bit with E CD. While we don’t think this is enough to get lane Lee Sin over the line, should be a decent buff for him"

[E] Tempest/Cripple buffs:

[E2] Cripple slow adjusted 20/35/50/65/80% >>> 35/45/55/65/75%

Cooldown reduced 9 >>> 8 seconds

Mordekaiser
"Morde is looking pretty weak and got indirectly nerfed from Liandrys, he also has a pretty shallow mastery curve, so giving him some power back"

[Q] Obliterate base spell rank damage increased 80/110/140/170/200 >>> 80/115/150/185/220

Nidalee
"Nidalee changes are focused mainly on her AP build; leaving top intact"

[Cougar-E] Swipe AP ratio increased 40% >>> 55%

Samira
"Samira has been out of the meta, especially in high levels of play for a long while. With Shieldbow gone, she’s been struggling with being able to pop off on her first item spike and her laning has been nerfed considerably (especially with the MS nerf from a while ago). We’re returning some of that, so she can pick better angles to take an engage and keep up with retreating enemies"

[P-Style] Daredevil Impulse - Style bonus Move Speed per Style stack increased 2/2.5/3/3.5% >>> 2.75/3/3.25/3.5% (based on levels 1/6/11/16) (maximum increased 12/15/18/21% >>> 16.5/18/19.5/21%)

[Q] Flair base damage increased 0/5/10/15/20 >>> 5/10/15/20/25

Twisted Fate
"Twisted Fate has also been struggling to keep up with the meta, because he’s often a bit too slow to get going; looking to allow him to try and get the game going faster compared to his other global or semi-global contemporaries like Taliyah, Galio (or if Sylas can just take his ult). Situational angles for AD TF to also be playable in some spots"

[E] Stacked Deck bonus Attack Speed increased 10/20/30/40/50% >>> 15/25/35/45/55%

[R] Destiny cooldown reduced 180/150/120 >>> 160/130/100 seconds

Zeri
"Zeri has been away from the meta for a while and sporting pretty good metrics for average players. Out of the 3 things Zeri stands out on compared to the roster (kiting, teamfighting, getting picks), teamfighting is both the most exciting and the most accessible for regular players, so we’re opting to index power there"

[R] Lightning Crash buffs:

Nova damage increased 175/275/375 (+85% bAD) (+110% AP) >>> 200/300/400 (+100% bAD) (+110% AP)

Overcharged chain lightning AD ratio increased 30% >>> 40%

>>> Champion Nerfs <<<
"Hearing a bunch of chatter about not nerfing Shen; while he’s a tad strong, he does good things for the game by being a champ that can slow down damage and also adds some strategic diversity in being that tank/fighter split hybrid. Additionally, his mastery curve is not the steepest, so while he has a high winrate, people are decently performant on him at low mastery levels, which bumps his winrate up"

Ahri
"Ahri is getting a bit of a tap down in a way that doesn’t change her W vs E incentives too much (E max 2nd is normally prioritized in higher levels of play). We want to retain how important it is for her to land it for damage, so we’re choosing CC, which will sometimes let players get out of Charms where they otherwise wouldn't have on Live (esp when they have Merc Treads)"

[E] Charm duration reduced 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8/2 >>> 1.2/1.35/1.5/1.65/1.8 seconds

[R] Spirit Rush cooldown increased 130/115/100 >>> 140/120/100 seconds

Azir
"Finally, some pretty straightforward nerfs to Azir’s output"

Base Move Speed reduced 335 >>> 330

Bonus Attack Speed per level reduced 6% >>> 5.5%

Gwen
"Gwen has been strong for a while; looking to open a bit more windows for opponents to gain an advantage on her early through higher early W CD and lower base health before she gets her scaling going"

Base HP reduced 620 >>> 600

[W] Hallowed Mist cooldown increased 22/21/20/19/18 >>> 24/22.5/21/19.5/18 seconds

Kalista
"Kalista is receiving some straight nerfs to make her more assailable in the early game and need to be a little more careful with her all-in timings"

Base HP reduced 580 >>> 560

[Q] Pierce cooldown increased 8 >>> 9 seconds

Neeko
"Neeko has been one of the top supports for a while, in the short term, we’re moving power away from her Q harass in the early game and skewing it towards her more AP heavy builds. While she does get a lot of value from her W and its contribution to vision control with all the tricks she can do with it, it’s one of the unique things she can do in support, so we opted to hit her damage output instead (and let her keep doing the cool thing)"

[Q] Blooming Burst initial damage adjusted 80/125/170/215/260 (+50% AP) >>> 60/110/160/210/260 (+60% AP)

[W-P] Shapesplitter on-hit base damage reduced 40/75/110/145/180 >>> 30/65/100/135/170

Rumble
[Q] Flamespitter target's max HP ratio per tick reduced 0.5/0.583/0.667/0.75/0.833% >>> 0.5/0.542/0.583/0.625/0.666% (2/2.33/2.67/3/3.33% >>> 2/2.167/2.33/2.5/2.667% per second)

[E] Electro Harpoon slow reduced 15/20/25/30/35% >>> 10/15/20/25/30%

Senna
"Senna was just overbuffed in AD"

[P] Absolution - Mist Wraith spawn rate on minions and monsters killed by Senna increased 14% >>> 10%

Taliyah
"Taliyah, we’re giving more windows for opponents to find earlier kill angles on her and nerf her trading before her Seraphs turns on and makes her too durable. She also just outputs too much damage for how tanky she is, so a few nerfs to both aspects"

Base Magic Resistance reduced 30 >>> 28

[Empowered-Q] Threaded Volley Boulder damage ratio reduced 190% >>> 180%

Varus
Base Armor reduced 27 >>> 24

Yorick
"Yorick is still a tad strong, looking to improve item diversity for him by moving power away from Attack Speed bindings (Trinity) into other items while also nerfing him"

[P] Shepherd of Souls - Mist Walker bonus Attack Speed reduced 100% flat Yorick's bonus Attack Speed >>> 8-80% (based on levels 1-18, linear)

[Q] Last Rites base bonus damage reduced 30/55/80/105/130 >>> 30/50/70/90/110

>>> Champion Adjustments <<<
Rammus - Phreak's Video
"Finally Rammus, we're making some changes to make him more generically pickable. His identity compared to Malphite is more of a durable champ that goes fast and having him be too tied to armor is hurting his viability somewhat.

He'll still benefit from building defensive and his taunt is still very good against auto attackers (because they'll damage themselves), but just a little less polarizing"

Base AD increased 55 >>> 65

Base Attack Speed increased 0.656 >>> 0.7

Base Armor reduced 40 >>> 35

Armor per level reduced 5.5 >>> 4.5

[P] Spiked Shell changed 10 (+10% Armor) (*150% during [W] Defensive Ball Curl) on-hit magic damage >>> 0 (+15% Armor) (+15% Magic Resistance) AD

[Q] Powerball base damage increased 80/110/140/170/200 >>> 80/120/160/200/240

[W] Defensive Ball Curl adjustments:

Reflect damage changed (+100% [P] Spiked Shell on-hit damage) >>> 15 (+10% Armor) (+10% Magic Resistance)

Bonus Armor reduced 40 (+35/45/55/65/75% Armor) >>> 27 (+30/37.5/45/52.5/60% Armor)

Bonus Magic Resistance increased 10 (+30/35/40/45/50% Magic Resistance) >>> 27 (+30/37.5/45/52.5/60% Magic Resistance)

Now deals damage to Drake

Duration adjusted 6 (+0.4 per Rammus's basic attack) >>> 7 (+0 per Rammus's basic attack) seconds

[E] Frenzying Taunt changes:

No longer grants 20/25/30/35/40% bonus Attack Speed

Now deals 80/100/120/140/160 (+70% AP) magic damage to monsters on cast

Impact center no longer deals 0-50% (based on 800-1700 unit travel distance) bonus damage

Aftershock no longer deal 20/30/40 (+10% AP) >>> 0

Aftershock slow adjusted stacking impact slow >>> refresh initial slow duration (maximum reduced 60/70/80% >>> 30/40/50%)

Cooldown adjusted 90 >>> 120/105/90 seconds

Vi
"Vi is still the most present jungler in the Pro meta, so we're looking to try and correct some of this moving into the tournament"

[W] Denting Blows adjustments:

Target max HP damage adjusted 4/5.5/7/8.5/10% (+1% per 35 bAD) >>> 4/5/6/7/8% (+3.5% per 100 bAD)

Bonus Attack Speed reduced 30/37.5/45/52.5/60% >>> 30/35/40/45/50%

[E] Relentless Force damage adjusted 0/15/30/45/60 (+120% AD) (+100% AP) >>> 10/30/50/70/90 (+110% AD) (+100% AP)

>>> System Nerfs <<<
Grasp of the Undying
Damage max HP ratio reduced 3.5/2.1% >>> 3.5/1.4% (melee/ranged)

Heal max HP ratio reduced 1.3/0.78% >>> 1.3/0.52% (melee/ranged)
