ance post-mitigation damage heal ratio increased 80% >>> 100%

[E-P] Umbral Dash post-mitigation damage healing bonus HP ratio increased 0.9% per 100 bonus HP >>> 1.1% per 100 bonus HP

Aphelios
"Some buffs to Aphelios’ early game here, maintaining his “slow and assailable, but high output” playstyle. If there are spots he can be safe, he should be pumping output a lot better and this will be decent buffs to his early laning"

Base Attack Speed increased 0.64 >>> 0.665

[Calibrum-Q] Calibrum, the Sniper Rifle - Moonshot base damage increased 60/76.67/93.33/110/126.67/143.33/160 >>> 70/85/100/115/130/145/160 (based on levels 1/3/5/7/9/11/13)

[Severum-Q] Severum, the Scythe Pistol - Onslaught base bonus Move Speed increased 20% >>> 25%

Aurora
"Aurora struggles a bunch into some of the mages that outrange her and some of the tankier champions that she struggles to kill later in the game. Giving her more opportunities in the short term to play these lanes out without skewing her to top (where MR is less useful) and also bumping her AP Ratios on R, as they’re more likely to be effective compared to the Liandrys style builds that she often opts into in top lane"

Base Magic Resistance increased 30 >>> 32

[R] Between Worlds AP ratio increased 60% >>> 70%

Bard
"We considered a few changes for Bard, but opted to amp him up in his matchups where he’s free to roam (eg. Braum, Rakan, etc.) compared to buffing his early durability, so he could facetank Alistar engages for example. While that would make him viable, it’s not a particularly long term sustainable one"

Base Move Speed increased 330 >>> 335
