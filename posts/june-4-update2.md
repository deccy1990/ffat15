Yunara is poised to become the next major marksman added to League of Legends, and thanks to a set of new leaks, we now have our first look at her full ability kit. While official confirmation is still on the horizon, the source of this information—Big Bad Bear—has a strong track record of reliable early insights.

Expected to release with Spirit Blossom Act 2, Yunara brings a high-skill, spell-infused playstyle to the ADC role. Her gameplay centers around enhanced basic attacks, mobility, and spell-based utility, with an ultimate that amplifies every part of her kit.

Let’s break down everything that’s leaked so far.

🌸 Yunara’s Playstyle – An ADC Built Around Ability Enhancement
Yunara is designed as a hybrid marksman who blends on-hit damage, AoE effects, and spell-based mobility. Her kit borrows inspiration from champions like Ashe, Sivir, Kai’Sa, and even Zeri, but reworks those elements into something distinctly new.

At the heart of her design is a powerful ultimate ability that transforms her playstyle by enhancing all of her basic abilities when active.

🧪 R – Ultimate: Amplification Mode
When Yunara activates her ultimate, she enters a transcendent state that improves her Q, W, and E for a duration. It’s a moment of power, turning her into a high-mobility, AoE damage machine capable of dominating skirmishes and teamfights.

During this empowered state:

Q becomes permanently active
W becomes stickier and hits more targets
E becomes a fast, short-cooldown dash
This makes her ult a window of extreme pressure, much like Vayne’s Final Hour or Kai’Sa’s Killer Instinct with uptime-dependent decision-making.

🔥 Q – Empowered Auto Attacks
Yunara’s Q is compared to Ashe’s Q in function. It enhances her basic attacks, but instead of increasing attack speed, it causes auto attacks to deal small-area AoE damage around the target.

During her ultimate, her Q is always active, giving her consistent AoE damage output in teamfights without the need to activate it manually.

This gives her powerful waveclear and zone control, similar to Miss Fortune’s passive or Samira’s AoE interactions.

🌪️ W – Tracking Projectile
Yunara’s W is described as a mix between Sivir’s Boomerang Blade and a homing spell. When cast, it sticks to the target and slows them over time. The ability can hit multiple targets during her ultimate, which increases her threat in fights and her ability to kite or chase enemies.

This spell adds much-needed utility to her kit, providing both soft crowd control and poke.

🌫️ E – Invisibility and Movement
Her E is perhaps the most mobility-heavy part of her kit. Outside of her ultimate, it behaves similarly to Kai’Sa’s E, offering invisibility and a movement speed boost.

However, during her ultimate, the spell transforms into a dash with a very short cooldown. This gives her Zeri-like repositioning in fights and could be key to surviving burst or chasing down low-health targets.

It’s likely that Yunara will reward clean micro and positioning, and her E will be central to mastering her playstyle.

✨ Passive – Crit Scaling and On-Hit Interactions
Yunara’s passive adds bonus magic damage on critical strikes, which implies she will scale heavily with crit-based itemization.

There’s also a secondary component to her passive related to on-hit effects, but the details remain unclear. It may increase her synergy with items like Guinsoo’s Rageblade, Nashor’s Tooth, or Blade of the Ruined King, offering hybrid scaling or alternate builds.

If this passive functions as expected, she could emerge as one of the most flexible ADCs in terms of item paths.
